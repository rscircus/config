# config - moving dotfiles

Dotfiles for the 20th century.

## Motivation

Prior I used this [repo for my dotfiles](https://github.com/rscircus/dotfiles). It is a tangled mess of config files, scripts, Makefiles and package managers. Trailing the current \*nix trends towards a more and more spaghetti like state of package management[<sup id="fn1">1</sup>](#fn1).

After reading about these two approaches:

- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles
- http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html

I figured, that I'll use the prior. Eventually you'll find this: https://dotfiles.github.io/tutorials/ on your journey. It is a freaking rabbit hole... don't go there. You lose, the bank always wins.
